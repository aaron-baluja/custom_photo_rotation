## Photo Classification System

The program automatically classifies photos into these aspect ratio categories:

| Aspect Ratio | Category Name | Description | Layout Usage |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| 21:9 | Ultra-Wide/Panoramic | Very wide landscape photos | Single pane only |
| 16:9 | 16:9 Landscape | Wide landscape photos | Single pane, Center pane, Top right pane |
| 9:16 | 16:9 Vertical | Tall portrait photos | Single pane, Both dual panes, All triple pane panes, Bottom right pane |
| 4:3 | 4:3 Landscape | Standard landscape photos | Single pane, Center pane |
| 3:4 | 4:3 Vertical | Standard portrait photos | Single pane, Both dual panes, Bottom left pane |
| 1:1 | Square | Square photos | Single pane, Both dual panes, Top left pane |

**Tolerance System**: Photos that are close to these ratios (within 20-30% tolerance) are automatically categorized. For example, a 3010x3000 photo will be classified as "Square" even though it's not exactly 1:1.

```
Screen dimensions: 2560x1440
Configured layout type: auto
Layout rotation enabled with 4 layouts available
Available layouts: Single Pane, Dual Pane, Triple Pane, Quad Pane
Auto mode: Starting with layout: Single Pane

Layout Pane Summary:
  Main Pane (2560x1440): 214 photos
    Categories: ultra_wide, 16:9_landscape, 16:9_vertical, 4:3_landscape, 4:3_vertical, square

    Categories: 4:3_vertical, square
  Right Pane (1024x1440): 10 photos
    Categories: 4:3_vertical, 16:9_vertical
```

## Customization

### Layout Configuration
To change the layout behavior, modify the `config.txt` file:

```
# For automatic layout rotation (recommended)
LAYOUT_TYPE=auto

# For specific layout only
LAYOUT_TYPE=dual_pane

# Disable layout rotation
LAYOUT_ROTATION_ENABLED=false

# Adjust rotation timing (in milliseconds)
PHOTO_LAYOUT_CHANGE_INTERVAL=45000  # 45 seconds
```

### Photo Display Behavior
Photos are handled differently based on their aspect ratio category:

**‚úÖ Ultra-Wide/Panoramic Photos (21:9):**
- **Maintain aspect ratio** to preserve their cinematic appearance
- **Letterboxed** with black bars to fit within pane boundaries
- Designed for wide screen viewing without distortion or cropping
- Entire photo content is visible

**‚úÖ All Other Photo Types:**
- **Maintain aspect ratio** to preserve their natural appearance
- **Cropped to fill** their assigned pane dimensions completely
- Eliminates empty space without distorting the original aspect ratio
- Photos are scaled up to cover the pane, then center-cropped to fit exactly

**Layout-Specific Behavior:**
- **Single Pane**: All photos displayed appropriately for entire screen (2560√ó1440)
- **Dual Pane**:
  - Left pane (1536√ó1440): Ultra-wide letterboxed, others cropped to fill
  - Right pane (1024√ó1440): Ultra-wide letterboxed, others cropped to fill
- **Triple Pane**: Each pane (853√ó1440): Ultra-wide letterboxed, others cropped to fill

**Note**: Ultra-wide photos preserve their natural wide format with letterboxing, while standard photos use cropping for maximum screen utilization without distortion.

### Display Timing
To change the photo display interval within each layout:
```
# Change from 15 seconds to 10 seconds
DISPLAY_INTERVAL=10000
```

### Classification Tolerance
To adjust classification tolerance, modify the `tolerance` values in the `src/photo_classifier.py` file:
```python
'tolerance': 0.15  # 15% tolerance instead of 20%
```

## Debug Overlay System

The screen saver includes a debug overlay system that provides detailed information about photo selection and display.

### Debug Overlay Features

================================================================================
```

### Default State

Debug overlays are **hidden by default** and can be toggled on/off as needed during operation.

## Troubleshooting

- **No Images Display**: Check that your `config.txt` file has the correct path
- **Folder Not Found**: Verify the folder path exists and is accessible
- **No Supported Images**: Ensure your folder contains JPG, JPEG, or PNG files
- **Layout Not Available**: Check that your screen resolution meets the minimum requirements (‚â•1920x1080)
- **Layout Rotation Issues**: Verify `LAYOUT_ROTATION_ENABLED=true` and check `PHOTO_LAYOUT_CHANGE_INTERVAL` settings
- **Photo Classification Issues**: Press **v** to toggle debug overlays and verify photo categorization
- **Performance Issues**: Large images may take longer to load; consider resizing them beforehand
- **Exit Issues**: Use Ctrl+C in the terminal if the application becomes unresponsive
- **Log File Issues**: Check the `logs/` folder for detailed error information and session history

## Example Config File

```
# Screen Saver Configuration
# Path to the folder containing your images
IMAGE_FOLDER=C:\Users\Aaron\Pictures\Vacation Photos

# Display settings
DISPLAY_INTERVAL=15000
FULLSCREEN=true

# Layout settings
LAYOUT_TYPE=auto
LAYOUT_ROTATION_ENABLED=true
PHOTO_LAYOUT_CHANGE_INTERVAL=15000


```

**Note**: This will find all images in "Vacation Photos" and any subfolders, classify them by aspect ratio, and automatically rotate through all available layouts every 15 seconds, with each layout displaying appropriate photos for 15 seconds.
